So even if the annotated scope of some given type isn't very informative, the entire sentence isn't lost: you'd still have other paraphrase types, which are most likely annotated correctly. But Wahle's dataset (and consequently his training pipeline) doesn't account for this. Whatever process Wahle et al. used for generating that dataset on Huggingface seems to have an especially hard time with sentences in the original ETPC as exemplified above, but the issue happens throughout *all* their dataset."
